## Example Usage

Here's an overview of how to use some of the key modules in Advanced Math:

### Basic Math Operations

```javascript
const { BasicMath } = require('adv-math');

const sum = BasicMath.add(5, 3); // 8
const product = BasicMath.multiply(4, 6); // 24
```

### Complex Numbers

```javascript
const { ComplexNumber } = require('adv-math');

const num1 = new ComplexNumber(2, 3);
const num2 = new ComplexNumber(1, -1);

const result = ComplexNumber.add(num1, num2); // (3, 2)
```

### Linear Algebra

```javascript
const { Matrix, Vector } = require('adv-math');

const matrix = new Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]]);
const vector = new Vector([1, 2]);

const product = Matrix.multiply(matrix, vector); // [5, 11]
```

### Statistics

```javascript
const { Statistics } = require('adv-math');

const data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
const mean = Statistics.mean(data); // 6
const variance = Statistics.variance(data); // 8
```

Please refer to the documentation for detailed usage instructions for each module.
