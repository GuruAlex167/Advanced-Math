# Advanced Mathematics Library

The Advanced Mathematics Library (`adv-math`) is a comprehensive JavaScript library that provides a wide range of mathematical functions and operations. This library is designed to assist developers in performing advanced mathematical calculations in various domains such as basic arithmetic, linear algebra, statistics, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, financial mathematics, and more.

## Installation

You can install the `adv-math` library using npm:

```bash
npm install adv-math
```

## Usage

To use the `adv-math` library, you can import the specific modules or functions you need for your mathematical calculations. Below is a list of available modules:

- [BasicMath](#basicmath)
- [ComplexNumber](#complexnumber)
- [Matrix](#matrix)
- [Vector](#vector)
- [Statistics](#statistics)
- [Geometry](#geometry)
- [Trigonometry](#trigonometry)
- [Calculus](#calculus)
- [Financial](#financial)
- [Units](#units)
- [Equations](#equations)
- [Parser](#parser)
- [Random](#random)

### BasicMath

The `BasicMath` module provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Usage example:

```javascript
const BasicMath = require('adv-math').BasicMath;

const result = BasicMath.add(5, 3); // Result: 8
```

### ComplexNumber

The `ComplexNumber` module supports complex number operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and magnitude calculation.

Usage example:

```javascript
const ComplexNumber = require('adv-math').ComplexNumber;

const num1 = new ComplexNumber(3, 4);
const num2 = new ComplexNumber(1, 2);
const sum = num1.add(num2); // Result: ComplexNumber { real: 4, imaginary: 6 }
```
